# Pre-Work-Study-Guide
## A study guide for the pre-work werk

This project was to document the experience of Pre-Work at Columbia bootcamp. Not only did we detail the sections of the class with specific notes, we utilized our learned skills to complete the project itself. This project can act as a reference guide as we move futher into our studies, and will be regularly updated to reflect our learned items. 

The site details our notes for the following topics: 
HTML 
CSS
JavaScript
and the use of Git Hub to assist in the workflow


## Installation

In order to get the full experience, users must open "inspect" to view the JavaScript functions. The JS will generate one of the 4 topics at random to study. Once a topic is chosen, dive in! 

## Usage

Right click any part of the webpage to bring up the "inspect" optin in ChromeDev. Once found, your browser should look like the following screenshot:
